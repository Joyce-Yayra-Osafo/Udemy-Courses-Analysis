Findings and Analysis

1.	Course Distribution by Subject:
Insight: The majority of courses are concentrated in specific subjects. Web Design and Business Finance have the highest number of courses, while Musical Instruments and Graphic Design have fewer offerings.

Analysis: Udemy’s course creation tends to focus more on business-related and design fields, potentially due to higher demand in these areas.

2.	Course Level Distribution:
Insight: Most courses across all subjects are categorized as "Beginner" or "All Levels.Intermediate and Expect levels are not much represented in the courses.

Analysis: Udemy mainly serves learners who are at the early stages of their learning journey. The focus on beginner and all-level courses may reflect the general demand for accessible, entry-level content.

3.	Subscriber by Subject:
Insight: Web Design courses have the highest number of subscribers, followed by Business Finance. Subjects like Graphic Design and Musical Instruments have a lower number of subscribers.

Analysis: The high engagement in Web Design courses suggests strong demand for digital skills.

4.	Course Pricing:
Insight: The majority of paid courses fall within the $20 to $50 range. Interestingly, free courses tend to have more subscribers on average.

Analysis: The pricing strategy varies across subjects, possibly to attract the enrollment of subscribers. 

5.	Course Reviews vs. Subscribers:
Insight: There is a positive correlation between the number of reviews and the number of subscribers. Web Design and Business Finance courses show a clearer correlation, whereas Graphic Design and Musical Instruments exhibit more scattered relationships.

Analysis: Courses with more subscribers tend to receive more reviews, particularly in highly competitive subjects. However, not all subjects show the same level of engagement in terms of reviews, likely due to differing learner behaviour or course characteristics.

 6. Price Distribution of Paid Courses (Based on Number of Subscribers):
Insight: When analysing the number of subscribers per price range, it was observed that courses priced in lower ranges (e.g., $0–$20 or $21–$50) attract significantly more students, while higher-priced courses (e.g., $100+) may have fewer subscribers.

Analysis: This suggests a correlation between affordability and popularity, where more students enrol in lower-priced courses, reflecting price sensitivity in online learning. In contrast, higher-priced courses may offer specialized or advanced content but appeal to a smaller, more targeted audience.

Conclusion:

1. Web Design and Business Finance dominate Udemy's course offerings and subscriber base.
2. Free courses attract significantly more learners, especially in subjects where skills are easily transferable (e.g., web design).
3. Most Udemy courses target beginners, suggesting that the platform is focused on serving early-stage learners across various fields.
4. While higher-priced courses ($100+) might have fewer students, they could represent niche or advanced courses that cater to a specific audience willing to pay more for in-depth content.
